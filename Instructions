Create a navigation menu and name it ProdReco-(whateverproductname).

Add products to it, and the names of the products you want to display.

Edit the HANDLE of the naviation menu to be the same as the HANDLE of the product it's going to be displayed on.

(CSS)

I haven't completed CSS for this, but I have added this to my CSS as a first step, it needs some adjusting for mobile.

.grid-uniform {
  	display: flex;
    flex-flow: row wrap;
    justify-content: space-around;
}
  
.product-grid__item-title {
  	text-align:center;
}
