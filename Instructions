1) Create snippet called prodreco-dynamic and copy/paste the code from here into it -https://github.com/paulsharer/manual-prod-recos/blob/master/prodreco-dynamic.liquid

2) Add a unique tag into the product you want to display your recommendations on. Let's call it ProductX

3) Open product.liquid and place the word TEST into it until you find where it displays where you want it. Then, copy the code from here https://github.com/paulsharer/manual-prod-recos/blob/master/put-into-product.liquid

4) Replace 'TAG-OF-PRODUCT-THAT-HOSTS-RECOMMENDATIONS' into the product.liquid code with the tag you added in step 2.

5) Create a navigation menu and name it ProdReco-(whateverproductname).

6) Add products to it, and the names of the products you want to display.

7) Edit the HANDLE of the naviation menu to be the same as the HANDLE of the product it's going to be displayed on.

(CSS)

I haven't completed CSS for this, but I have added this to my CSS as a first step, it needs some adjusting for mobile.

.grid-uniform {
  	display: flex;
    flex-flow: row wrap;
    justify-content: space-around;
}
  
.product-grid__item-title {
  	text-align:center;
}
