1) Create snippet called prodreco-master and copy/paste the code from here into it -https://github.com/paulsharer/manual-prod-recos/blob/master/prodreco-master.liquid

2) Add a unique tag into the product you want to display your recommendations on, reco-tag1. ALSO add tag 'hasreco' so it triggers the prodreco-master.liquid.

3) Open product.liquid and place the word TEST into it until you find where it displays where you want it. Then, copy the code from here https://github.com/paulsharer/manual-prod-recos/blob/master/put-into-product.liquid

4) Create a navigation menu and name it reco-tag1.

6) Add products to it, and the names of the products you want to display.

**Not working? Did you add 'hasreco' tag to products that have a recommendation? Did you add conditions into prodreco-master?**

(Add CSS to customize)

I haven't completed CSS for this, but I have added this to my CSS as a first step, it needs some adjusting for mobile.

.grid-uniform {
  	display: flex;
    flex-flow: row wrap;
    justify-content: space-around;
}
  
.product-grid__item-title {
  	text-align:center;
}
